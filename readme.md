# Download video and/or audio from YouTube

This utility is a Windows (WPF) application to download videos from YouTube without spy- or adware. It is based on the nuget package of Dennis Daume https://github.com/flagbug/YoutubeExtractor and like almost everything, on Json.Net http://james.newtonking.com/json

## Download
[Download the app](https://github.com/jphellemons/DownloadYouTube/blob/master/DownloadYouTube/publish/setup.exe?raw=true "Download")
## Background
I decided to build this small application because there are a lot of them available but all contain ads or spyware or bloated installers which install toolbars etc.
The reason why I chose to make a Windows application instead of a webapplication is because it is possible to block a single ip of a webserver or a hostname, but it is harder to block

## Requirements
- You need the .Net framework 4.5.1 https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40779
- Windows Vista (sp2) or higher
