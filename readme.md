# Download video and/or audio from YouTube

This utility is a Windows (WPF) application to download videos from YouTube without spy- or adware. It is based on the [nuget package of Dennis Daume](https://github.com/flagbug/YoutubeExtractor) and like almost everything, on [Json.Net]( http://james.newtonking.com/json)
It is intended for backup usage. Please only download your own content and respect the rights of the artists/producers etc.

## Download
[Download the app](https://github.com/jphellemons/DownloadYouTube/blob/master/DownloadYouTube/publish/DownloadYouTube.application?raw=true "Download")
I am trying to get this in the Windows Store atm.

## Background
I decided to build this small application because there are a lot of them available but all contain ads or spyware or bloated installers which install toolbars etc.
The reason why I chose to make a Windows application instead of a webapplication is because it is possible to block a single ip of a webserver or a hostname, but it is harder to block
